Object Tracker
API: Tracker.h

The software tracks the pose of an object in real time, given it's shape and texture.

    * Input: Camera image and ply file describing the 3D shape of the object (faces, vertices)
    * Output: 3D pose of the object 

Requirements

    * NVIDIA graphics card, with correctly installed driver software
    * TomGine

OpenCV is used for loading and saving images, which also will be replaced in future by DevIL, a independent image library.
Keyboard mapping

    * [ESCAPE]: Close Tracker and OpenGL Window
    * [1]: Set mismatch tolerance to 0 pixel
    * [2]: Set mismatch tolerance to 1 pixel
    * [3]: Set mismatch tolerance to 2 pixel
    * [4]: Use EDGES for pose match evaluation (more robust convergence to true pose)
    * [5]: Use COLOR for pose match evaluation (more robust to fast, blury movements)
    * [a]: Toggle between high accuracy and robustness for fast movement (i.e. high accuracy needed for capturing textures)
    * [e]: Show result of edge extraction of image
    * [i]: Print information on current tracking status (number of particles, confidence, weight, variance, ...)
    * [l]: Lock object at current pose / pause tracking
    * [m]: Switch between different modes of displaying the object (textured, wireframed, edge match, dont display)
    * [p]: Show particles
    * [r]: Reset object to initial pose
    * [s]: Save object and textures to ply/jpg files
    * [t]: Capture texture from camera image and attach it to the object
    * [u]: Untexture / remove texture from object
