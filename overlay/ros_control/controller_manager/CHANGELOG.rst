Changelog for package controller_manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.5.6 (2013-07-29)
------------------

0.5.7 (2013-07-30)
------------------
* Update controller_manager.cpp
  getControllerNames now clears names before adding current names.  This fixes a bug in reloadControllerLibrariesSrv where the method is called twice in a row without first clearing the list.
  Steps to reproduce:
  - Spawn controller
  - Stop controller
  - reload-libraries
  controller_manager.cpp:501: bool controller_manager::ControllerManager::reloadControllerLibrariesSrv(controller_manager_msgs::ReloadControllerLibraries::Request&, controller_manager_msgs::ReloadControllerLibraries::Response&): Assertion `controllers.empty()' failed.
